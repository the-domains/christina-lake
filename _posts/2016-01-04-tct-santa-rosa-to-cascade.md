A  popular trip for those wanting to encounter majestic waterfalls, an inspiring gorge, fascinating ghost-town history and expansive bridges all in one trail.

Starting our journey at the Santa Rosa Rd Parking lot, encounter three historical transportation routes.

The old Cascade Highway which connected HWY 3 to Rossland until 1962 , the Columbia & Western Rail Trail built in 1899  and the oldest, the Dewdney Trail from 1865\.

From here travel south/west where the valley opens up below and follow the train grade along the scenic mountain side.

Around the corner is the Kettle River Bridge, the longest to cross this river at 505 feet, a mere fraction of what was once a majestic 1600 foot wooden trestle bridge from 1899 until 1912\.

A great place to stop and take photos, enjoy the 360 degree view or venture down the stairs to the sandy beach below.

Continue along through the ghost of Cascade City, founded in 1896, and at one time boasting 14 hotels, numerous brothels and even a scandalous tobacco robbery!

After 2 major fires in 1899 and 1901 the city slowly declined, but not before leaving a colorful mark on Christina Lake history.

Further up and just a few minutes off of the Trans Canada Trail is the stunning Cascade Falls making its grand entrance from the Cascade Gorge.

Originally known as Coyote Canyon, this area was an important fishing ground to the Sinixt, Sanpoil, Okanagan and other first nation tribes.

Multiple vantage points provide great (and dangerous) views of the powerful falls.

For thousands of years the  river waters have carved smooth the granite walls catching small rocks along the way making hundreds of potholes, also referred to as 'kettles', leaving some to suggest the origin of the Kettle River's name.

So powerful and enticing are these waters that a hydro-electric dam and power station were built in 1898, providing the much needed electrical needs of the booming mining and lumber industries.

It closed operations in 1910, and was dismantled in 1922\. A few artifacts of the history can be found including an impressive 450 foot tunnel, remains of the penstock gates and the powerhouse foundation.

Ending our adventure we find ourselves atop a second bridge, this one spanning the Cascade Gorge, providing many more photo opportunities. A popular summer spot for locals, this stunning cut is a reminder of the power of nature.

While the Santa Rosa to Cascade part of the Trans Canada Trail can easily be hiked in a part of a day -- the adventures throughout and off the trail can take DAYS to explore.

So go out and walk, hike or bike in the footsteps of pioneers from centuries gone by, who's dreams built the city, railway, roads, trails, bridges, dam and power-plant.

See the beauty of what attracted them to this unique area and discover that it's exactly what brought you here as well.
